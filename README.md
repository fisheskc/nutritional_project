# nutritional_project: I have used JavaScript, Mongo DB, Mongoose, Express, NPM packages, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML.
The NPM packages and the .env file (this included the passwords and API key for my cloudinary account which stores the
background homepage image) are not included in this respository. The Mongo DB is named "nutritions_db" and the NPM package
to run this is "nodemon app.js".
